# Module Four: ROS

## Introduction
In this fourth module, you will be introduced to ROS (Robot Operating System). It's an open source framework that allows us to develop and control the robot using the tools and libraries that it provides. We will show you how to install ROS and begin to make use of it. Please be sure to follow the instructions as they are written. We want to make sure that you are using the same version we use here in the lab.

## Module Readings

1. **Topics:** A communication channel used in the ROS framework to facilitate the exchange of data between different nodes in a robotic system. 
2. **Nodes:** Individual components that perform tasks, such as sensor data processing, motor control, or higher-level decision-making. They communicate with                each other by publishing and subscribing to topics.<br><br>
         2a. **Publisher:** A node that wants to share some data, such as sensor readings, and creates a topic and publishes messages to it.<br>
         2b. **Subscriber:** A node that is interested in the type of data that is being published and can subscribe to the topic. They receive the                                         messages published on the topic and can process the information as needed.<br>
         
3. **Messages:**
4. Packages
5. Code

Example:

Topic: "/move_robot"

Message Type: "geometry_msgs/Twist"

## Assignment

```
1.  Sign into your GitHub Account.

2.  Go to your repository: <YourName>_Training_Modules

3.  Edit your Readme file and format it using the following:
      - Please use a 5 line gap after the previous assignment
      - The first line: "<YourName> Module Four" using H1 (header one)
      - The third line: "Answers:" using H2 (header two)
      - The fifth line: Start an ordered List (1.)



6.  And now you are done! Commit your changes by clicking the 'Commit changes...' button and set the commit message to "Completed Task Four"
